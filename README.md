# pd3-damage-calculators
A group of Python scripts that calculate the number of shots to kill all enemy types in Payday 3.

Simply run the script and enter the values you want to test. The program will then spit out the number of shots to kill every enemy type that it has stats for.

Each calculator has a specific name for its specific purpose. If you want the number of body shots, enter the crit multiplier as 1.

You can determine the number of pellets to kill with shotguns by using the shotgun stats and treating "shots" as "pellets". If the number of "shots" is higher than the number of pellets the shotgun fires, then it will take more than one shot to kill.
