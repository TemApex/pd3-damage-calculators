# pd3-headshot-calculator
Python script that calculates the number of headshots to kill all enemy types in Payday 3.

To run this you will need to have Python 3 installed. Simply run the code and enter the values you want to test (where you find those values is up to you). The program will then spit out the number of shots to kill every enemy type that it has stats for.
