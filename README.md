# pd3-damage-calculators
A group of Python scripts that calculate the number of shots to kill all enemy types in Payday 3.

To run this you will need to have Python 3 installed. Simply run the script and enter the values you want to test. The program will then spit out the number of shots to kill every enemy type that it has stats for.

Each calculator has a specific name for its specific purpose. If you want the number of body shots, enter the headshot multiplier as 1.
